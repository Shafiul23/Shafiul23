<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Shafiul</h1>

- 🎓 **About Me:** I graduated from UCL in 2022 with a degree in Chemistry with Mathematics, but discovered my true passion in technology. The fast-paced evolution of the tech world and the satisfaction of solving complex problems inspired me to pivot my career into software engineering.

- 💻 **Journey into Tech:** My coding journey began in 2021 with a programming module during my degree. That interest grew into a commitment when I joined the Digital Futures Academy in 2022, completing an intensive full-stack bootcamp covering Java, JavaScript, Node, and React. Since then, I’ve built multiple full-stack projects and continued to expand my skills.

- 🔨 **Professional Experience:**  
  I’m currently Front-End Software Engineer at Cushon, specialising in building scalable, user-friendly front-end applications with React and occasionally React Native, using TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. I also have past experience supporting back-end development with Java and Spring Boot.

- 🔑 **Notable Projects:**
  - **Squad Dashboard** – Full-stack app to monitor microservice statuses within Sky’s Identity department, with live hourly updates.
  - **Lift as We Climb** – React Native mobile app with dynamic timetables, interactive maps, and event management.
  - **TypeTester** – Full-stack typing speed test app (Flask + React + PostgreSQL) with JWT auth, leaderboards, and user profiles.
  - **Habee** – A React Native habit-tracking app with calendar views, weekly grids and daily reminder. Currently deployed on the App Store.
