<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Shafiul</h1>

- 🎓 About Me: I graduated from UCL with a degree in Chemistry with Mathematics in 2022 but found my true passion in technology. The rapid evolution of the tech world and the rewarding nature of solving complex technical problems inspired me to pivot my career towards software engineering.

- 💻 Journey into Tech: My coding journey began in 2021 with a programming module during my degree. This sparked my interest, leading me to join Digital Futures Academy in 2022, where I completed an intensive full-stack software engineering bootcamp.

- 🔨 Professional Experience: Currently, I work as a Front-End Engineer at Sky, where I specialise in building scalable, user-friendly applications with React, TypeScript, and Next.js. My work also involves supporting back-end development tasks using Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and DynamoDB, as well as containerising applications with Docker.

- 🔑 Key Projects:
  - Squad Dashboard: A full-stack application to monitor microservice statuses within Sky’s Identity department, featuring live hourly updates.
  - Lift as We Climb App: A React Native mobile app with dynamic timetables, interactive maps, and event management.
  - TypeTester: A full-stack application built with Flask, React, and PostgreSQL, allowing users to test typing speed and compete on a leaderboard.
